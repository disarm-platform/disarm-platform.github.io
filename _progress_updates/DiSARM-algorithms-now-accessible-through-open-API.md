In an effort to make DiSARM algorithms more accessible, the DiSARM team has built and launched the DiSARM Application Programming Interface (API). The DiSARM API will provide a curated set of algorithms accessible either headless (i.e. without an interface) or wired up to an interface. These include algorithms to get values of bioclimatic and environmental values at points, to cluster buildings into operational units for field teams and to estimate the locations of villages from population data.

For more information about what algorithms are available, how to access them, along with their source code, see the [DiSARM docs](docs.disarm.io) page.
