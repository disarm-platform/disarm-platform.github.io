In an effort to make DiSARM algorithms more accessible, the DiSARM team has built and launched the DiSARM Application Programming Interface (API). The DiSARM API will provide a curated set of algorithms accessible either headless (i.e. without an interface) or wired up to an interface. For more information about what algorithms are available, how to access them, along with their source code, see the DiSARM docs page.
