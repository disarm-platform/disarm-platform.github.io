With support from the Clinton Health Access Initiative, DiSARM is being used to support the planning, implementation and monitoring of indoor residual insecticide spraying campaigns in Namibia, Botswana and Zimbabwe and is being piloted in South Africa. Programs are able to combine risk maps with population and building data to prioritize areas for targeted spraying. In the field, teams can collect data offline which once synced can be visualized in near-real time using maps, charts and tables allowing operations to be refined if need be.
