In 2018, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and the Clinton Health Access Initiative awarded a subcontract to Akros to develop Reveal—a system designed to guide more precise and impactful delivery of malaria services and an expansion of the approach and technology of its predecessor, mSpray. Built in partnership with the software development firm Ona, Reveal is a geospatial platform designed to manage household-level interventions, including IRS, LLIN distribution, focus investigation, RACD, and MDA, to ensure accurate and effective coverage. Reveal is built on select functionality components of OpenSRP, DiSARM, and mSpray and integrates with health management information systems, such as DHIS2. The platform contains both web and mobile components; the web-interface provides users with DiSARM’s planning and prioritizing capabilities to plan campaigns and provides monitoring and management tools like routine and customizable dashboards to ensure campaign effectiveness. The mobile app for Reveal incorporates OpenSRP household monitoring, originally developed for frontline health workers, and mSpray’s mobile functionality, offline sync support, built-in decision-making protocols, and spatial navigation.

Users will be able to access DiSARM’s algorithms through the Reveal tool including the DiSARM “building cluster” algorithm and a “population extractor.” In 2019, Reveal will be piloted in southern Africa and in Thailand. The DiSARM team is supporting Reveal by sharing experience in the development of digital tools to support malaria programs and building geospatial algorithms which can be plugged into Reveal via the DiSARM API.
