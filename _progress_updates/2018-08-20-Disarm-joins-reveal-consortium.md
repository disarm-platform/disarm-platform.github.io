In 2018, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and the Clinton Health Access Initiative awarded a subcontract to Akros to migrate the mSpray tool into a new data visualization platform called Reveal. Built by the software development firm Ona, Reveal is a geospatial tool designed to manage household-level interventions, including IRS, LLIN distribution, focus investigation, RACD, and MDA, to ensure accurate and effective coverage. Reveal will integrate select functionality components of OpenSRP, DiSARM, and mSpray while integrating with health management information systems, such as DHIS2. Reveal’s web-interface will use DiSARM’s planning and prioritizing capabilities and Canopy dashboards for monitoring. The mobile app for Reveal will incorporate OpenSRP household monitoring, originally developed for frontline health workers, and mSpray’s mobile functionality, offline sync support, built-in decision-making protocols and spatial navigation.
 
Users will be able to access DiSARM’s algorithms through the Reveal tool including the DiSARM “building cluster” algorithm and a “population extractor.” In 2019, Reveal will be piloted in southern Africa and in Thailand. The DiSARM team is supporting Reveal by sharing experience in the development of digital tools to support malaria programs and building geospatial algorithms which can be plugged into Reveal via the DiSARM API.
