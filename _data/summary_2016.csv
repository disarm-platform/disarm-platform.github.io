YES,"Codename ""DOUMA""","Universal, offline, multi-device application: works with and without network, on desktop and tablet and mobile. The aim is to make this a place where all the interactions with DiSARM can take place - including IRS, foci investigation, etc. Name to be decided.",1 - active development,"douma-meta,douma-foci-gif",Y,Y,http://duma-stage.surge.sh,
YES,Pipeline-R (and dashboard),"The component which models malaria risk from case locations and environmental data, and generates a range of outputs for further use, including risk maps. Includes a graphical admin interface to make it simple to see what is happening, what maps have been created, what data is needed, etc. Designed to be installed on a server in-country, and to be managed by each NMCP.",1 - active development,DiSARM_Pipeline_3,N,N,https://davesteps.shinyapps.io/pipeline-r/,
YES,Google EarthEngine imagery export scripts,"Manages a regular export of environmental data from Google Earth Engine, packaging the information so it's readily available for each country pipeline to use in the generation of risk models and maps. This runs on one remote server which does the processing for all countries.",1 - active development,kfkhldiie5eph1dcqn0g.png ,N,,just code,
YES,Core Interface,"The original interface designed to make it easy to view and explore the outputs from the DiSARM pipeline. Customised for Swaziland and for Zimbabwe/Mat-South, it contains a timeline which allows you to navigate through time, viewing the risk map and data for any given month.",1 - active development,,,,http://swz-core.disarm.io,
