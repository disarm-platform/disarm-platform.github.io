title: Buildings Clusterer
description: This algorithm clusters buildings into groups. The user can specify the minimum and maximum number of builidngs per cluster, as well as the maximum distance between any two buildings in a cluster. It is also possible to ensure that no clusters intersect lines (e.g. roads, rivers or admin boundaries).
