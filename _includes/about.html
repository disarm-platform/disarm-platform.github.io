      Using data can lead to more impactful decision making over intuition
      alone. But collecting, analyzing, and visualizing data is difficult,
      especially in resource constrained settings. The Disease Surveillance and
      Risk Monitoring (DiSARM) project is building an open-source platform that
      enables disease control programs to better target interventions spatially,
      guide field teams more precisely, and evaluate coverage more robustly. The
      DiSARM platform is comprised of a web-based application and a set of
      customized algorithms accessible through an application programming
      interface (API).

      The DiSARM project is lead by the Malaria Elimination Initiative at the
      University of California San Francisco in collaboration with Peoplesized
      and the Clinton Health Access Initiative. The project is supported by the
      Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Task Force on Global Health, and Google.
