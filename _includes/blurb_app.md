# DiSARM Application 

The DiSARM app is a spatial intelligence tool that supports disease control programs in carrying out intervention field campaigns in a more efficient and accurate way. While the DiSARM app requires a network connection to access and sync data collected from the field, the app can run offline on any device with a web-browser (desktop, laptop, tablet, smart phone). In its current form, the DiSARM app is being used to implement insecticide residual spray campaigns in southern Africa.
