## DiSARM Algorithms

Similarly, while programs often have access to valuable data on locations of buildings, it typically isn’t known which are residential or not, thus limiting their value. DiSARM’s building predictor algorithm identifies residential buildings, allowing programs to proactively plan for the number of houses that may require intervention coverage. Programs can organize their field teams more efficiently by knowing exactly how many fieldworkers are needed and where they should go. 


## DiSARM API
DiSARM is making algorithms available via an Application Programming Interface (API). Essentially, the API will provide a way for machine to machine running of algorithms. This means that if someone wants to use one of our algorithms, they don’t have to send their data to a human to crunch the numbers and send back the result, they can just send data to the API over the web, and the API gives them back the result. In addition to the benefits of automation, the API will allow the algorithms to be plugged into user interfaces and apps such as the DiSARM app and Reveal. Additionally, the API will allow the DiSARM platform to extend its algorithms and tools to support predictive mapping and surveillance of Neglected Tropical Diseases. Check back soon for documentation on how to use the API.
